Mirai Botnet Traffic Anlaysis - Honours Thesis
----------------------------------------------

This repository contains scripts used for the pre-processing and analysis of attack traffic generated by mirai.
Attack traffic was generated by launching attacks in a sandbox environment, but the traffic is too large to upload here.


    
TODO
----

### IDS - Snort

- Script reporting summary for IDS detection results (count number of
alerts generated by each ruleset on each dataset)
- Better understand snort rule syntax

### Traffic Mining - Flows (Argus/Tranalyzer)

- 10-fold cross validation for 6-attack dataset
- proper data cleaning procedure for Nan given by argus
- Better understand features in argus and tranalyzer
- Output pre-processed csv that can be used by weka
- Create dataset with legitimate traffic to test
- Repeat process-argus functionality for tranalyzer output


### Future Problems

- Generate snort rules from decision trees
-
