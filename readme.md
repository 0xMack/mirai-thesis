Mirai Botnet Traffic Analysis - Honours Thesis
----------------------------------------------

This repository contains scripts used for the pre-processing and analysis of attack traffic generated by mirai.
Attack traffic was generated by launching attacks in a sandbox environment, but the traffic is too large to upload here.

Datasets
--------
**argus_6attack:** 6 types of Mirai DDoS attack traffic captured in
isolated lab environment. Attack types are 'ack', 'vse', 'greip',
'greeth', 'syn' and 'udp'. The capture packets were converted to flows
using Argus.

**tranalyzer_6attack:** Same as argus_6attack, but the pcaps are
converted to flows with Tranalyzer instead of Argus.

**CTU-Malware-Capture-Botnet-45:**

Results
-------
### Traffic Mining - Flow Analysis
argus_6attack - python and weka decision trees

    
TODO
----

### IDS - Snort

- Script reporting summary for IDS detection results (count number of
alerts generated by each ruleset on each dataset)
- Better understand snort rule syntax

### Traffic Mining - Flows (Argus/Tranalyzer)

- Better understand features in argus and tranalyzer
- Include direction and state features as categorical values
- Map hex features?


### TODO
- Put through snort (use pcaps)
- Try only using pcaps for times while used flows time frame (cut background traffic out)


### Completed
- ~~10-fold cross validation for 6-attack dataset~~
- ~~proper data cleaning procedure for Nan given by argus~~
- ~~Output pre-processed csv that can be used by weka~~
- ~~Repeat process-argus functionality for tranalyzer output~~
- ~~Table of number of flows~~
- ~~CTU - Capture 5 - Test on bot flows, then cnc flows, first 1000, no background flows~~
- ~~Get rid of background, reduce remaining to normal, botnet and cnc~~
- ~~BALANCED: Botnet (800/101), normal(800/rest-of-data) ... (train/test)~~
- ~~UNBALANCED: 66%/33% split~~
- ~~Normal(4676), Botnet(901)~~
