Mirai Botnet Traffic Analysis - Honours Thesis
----------------------------------------------

This repository contains scripts used for the pre-processing and analysis of attack traffic generated by mirai.
Attack traffic was generated by launching attacks in a sandbox environment, but the traffic is too large to upload here.

Datasets
--------
**argus_6attack:** 6 types of Mirai DDoS attack traffic captured in
isolated lab environment. Attack types are 'ack', 'vse', 'greip',
'greeth', 'syn' and 'udp'. The capture packets were converted to flows
using Argus.

**tranalyzer_6attack:** Same as argus_6attack, but the pcaps are
converted to flows with Tranalyzer instead of Argus.

**CTU-Malware-Capture-Botnet-45:**
